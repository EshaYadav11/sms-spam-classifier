# ðŸ“± SMS Spam Classifier: Detecting Unwanted Messages with Machine Learning

This project detects whether an SMS message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Machine Learning.  
It uses text preprocessing, Bag of Words, and compares **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** models.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Preprocessed SMS text (lowercasing, stopword removal)
- Bag of Words text representation
- Model comparison: **Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression**
- Achieved **~98% accuracy**
- Confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation
- Tested with custom real-life messages (color-coded output: Spam in red, Not Spam in green âœ…)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Logistic Regression: ~98% accuracy  
- Naive Bayes: ~96% accuracy  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the notebook.  
2. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
